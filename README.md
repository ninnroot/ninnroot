### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Thiha Swan Htet. A fullstack developer from Myanmar (currently studying in Singapore!). I love data and automation.

I do web development and a little bit of DevOps and machine learning. I am comfortable with Python, JavaScript and Java. I am willing to collaborate on Python projects.


Here is my website => [thiha.net](https://thiha.net). Check it out for my contacts.
(Hosted on Heroku and the server sleeps, so you might have to wait for a while to wake it up)
