### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Thiha Swan Htet. A fullstack developer from Myanmar (currently studying in Singapore!). 

I do web development and a little bit of DevOps and machine learning. I am comfortable with Python, JavaScript and Java, and am very skilled in Django [writing DRY codes](https://github.com/ninnroot/duwin_backend/blob/master/core/schemas.py). I am willing to collaborate on Python projects.

See how to reach me via my website => [thiha.net](https://thiha.net).
